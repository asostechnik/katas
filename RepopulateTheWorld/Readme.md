*Repopulate the world kata*
---
The zombie apocolypse has wiped out almost everyone in the world. Only three women and three men survived:

 - Elizabeth (F)
 - Molly (F)
 - Jessica (F)
 - Man1 (M)
 - Man2 (M)
 - Man3 (M)

The survivors salvaged enough junk to build an AI to help them repopulate the world in the most optimal way. They programmed it with the following rules:

1. To ensure survival of the human race the population mut reach one million (1000000)
2. Each woman should have four children before retiring from the programme
2. To ensure the genetic stability of the human race, two people can reproduce only if:
	a. They are of the same generation
	b. They do not share the same parents
3. To balance rule 1 can only have one baby every eighteen months
4. 


You are that AI. Go.
